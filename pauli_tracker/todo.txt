---------- release new major

- implement more gates

- maybe use https://docs.rs/err-derive/latest/err_derive/#
- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

- write a better contributing.md
- write a proper todo.md

- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests

- don't generate trait methods with macros, that's not so good with rust-analyzer's
  "implement members" feature

- maybe make a proc crate for all the macros that are not so good
- ergonomic trait implementations
