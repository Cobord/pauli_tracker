- somehow make the manylinux_2_28_aarch64 container work (cf. comments
  .github/workflows/pypackage.yml); not the most important thing, because people on linux
  with aarch64 know how to install it from source

------------

- inline some stuff

- an insert stack method for Frames which adopts its length to frames_num, or vice versa
  if the stack's length is longer (resize all other stacks)

- replace unreachable with unchecked_unreachable

- when things are pretty stable, instead of implementing methods through macros,
  implement them manually, this is because rust-analyzer has problems with it
  - wrong doc comments
  - "implement members" feature doesn't work completely

- implement more gates

- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

- write a better contributing.md
- write a proper todo.md

- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests

- maybe make a proc crate for all the macros that are not so good
- ergonomic trait implementations


---------- release new major

- remove deprecated stuff
- remove the default implementations for the `Tracker::remove_*` methods
