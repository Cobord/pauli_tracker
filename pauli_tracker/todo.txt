---------- release new major

- include transposed_reverted into lib docs

- when things are pretty stable, instead of implementing methods through macros,
  implement them manually, this is because rust-analyzer has problems with it
  - wrong doc comments
  - "implement members" feature doesn't work completely

- implement more gates

- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

- write a better contributing.md
- write a proper todo.md

- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests

- maybe make a proc crate for all the macros that are not so good
- ergonomic trait implementations
