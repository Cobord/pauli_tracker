# A helper for certain development tasks

Usage: Run
```bash
/path/to/xtask-binary
```
in the relevant directories, e.g., in `pauli_tracker` or `python_lib` (there should also
be soft links to it). The commands do not automatically check whether one is in the
correct directory or change into the direct directory. View the commands more like
(hopefully cross-platform) simple bash helper.
