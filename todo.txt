- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests
  - write helper for all the basic gate tests
  - better circuit module for testing
  - test boolean_vector impls
- define more clifford gates
- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

make create_dependency_graph more secure against wrong input, e.g., break the endless
loops

- more clifford gates

before next major bump:
- Pauli::storage don't return reference
- PauliVec's new to default and instead a real new
- change Pauli Display and Debug
- maybe remove deref for storage::Vector
- remove AsRef for LiveVector
- use real error types when returning an error, not just Strings
- pauli_insert -> return old value; and similar
- panics in create_dependency_graph to return error
- introduce a Node struct for DependencyGraph
- maybe put functions in storage.rs into StackStorage as default fns
