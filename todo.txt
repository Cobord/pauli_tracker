- maybe use lint missing_copy_implementation
- ergonomic trait implementations
- use hashbrown ...
- maybe use https://docs.rs/err-derive/latest/err_derive/#
- lock cargo hack
- lock msrv

- add some standard test for autotraits like send, sync, ..

- use PauliTuple for actions testing template

- maybe derive macro for sweep::impl_into_iterator

- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests
- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

- more clifford gates
- maybe: in storage::vector when inserting, do the same as as in livevector if index to
  high, i.e., insert buffer stacks


- write a better contributing.md

- maybe make a proc create for all the macros that are not so good

- write a proper todo.md

before next major bump:
- maybe remove deref for storage::Vector
- panics in create_dependency_graph to return error
- rewrite LiveVector to be generic like Frames

another major bump:
- maybe make Map's and Vector's inner type private (making Map to a newtype) and remove
  Deref(Mut) impls
