- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests
- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

- more clifford gates
- maybe: in storage::vector when inserting, do the same as as in livevector if index to
  high, i.e., insert buffer stacks

- add some standard test for autotraits like send, sync, ..

- write a better contributing.md

- write a proper todo.md

before next major bump:
- maybe remove deref for storage::Vector
- use real error types when returning an error, not just Strings
- panics in create_dependency_graph to return error
- maybe introduce a Node struct for DependencyGraph
- maybe put functions in storage.rs into StackStorage as default fns
- rename circuit measure_and_store_all to measure_and_store_remaining
- add a measure_remaining ot CliffordCircuit and or a qubit loop
- return Ok(measurement results) in the circuits measure methods

another major bump:
- rewrite LiveVector to be generic like Frames
- maybe make Map's and Vector's inner type private (making Map to a newtype) and remove
  Deref(Mut) impls
