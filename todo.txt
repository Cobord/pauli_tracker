- implement a file streaming storage
- more tests
  - write helper for all the basic gate tests
  - better circuit module for testing
  - test boolean_vector impls
- define more clifford gates
- maybe try to depend only on proptest when we really run proptest (for less
  dependencies in ci)

before next major bump:
- pauli_insert -> return old value; and similar
- more clifford gates
